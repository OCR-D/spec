# Conventions for PAGE

## URL for imageFilename / filename

The `imageFilename` of the `<pg:Page>` and `filename` of the `<pg:AlternativeImage>` element MUST be a URL. A local filename should be a `file://` URL.

All URL used in `imageFilename` and `filename` [MUST be referenced in a fileGrp in METS](https://ocr-d.github.io/mets#if-in-page-then-in-mets).

## Original image as imageFilename

The `imageFilename` attribute of the `<pg:Page>` MUST reference the original image and MUST NOT change between processing steps.

## AlternativeImage for derived images

To encode images derived from the original image, the `<pc:AlternativeImage>` should be used. Its `filename` attribute should reference the URL of the derived image.

The `comments` attribute should be one or more (separated by comma) terms of the following list:

## AlternativeImage: classification

The `comments` attribute of the `<pg:AlternativeImage>` attribute should be used

  * `binarized`
  * `deskewed`
  * `despeckled`
  * `cropped`
  * `rotated-90` / `rotated-180` / `rotated-270`
  * `dewarped`

## AlternativeImage on sub-page level elements

For the results of image processing that changes the positions of pixels (e.g. cropping, rotation, dewarping), `AlternativeImage` on page level and polygon of recognized zones is not enough to access the image section a region is based on since coordinates are always relative to the original image.

For such use cases, `<pg:AlternativeImage>` may be used as a child of `<pg:TextRegion>`, `<pg:TextLine>`, `<pg:Word>` or `<pg:Glyph>`.
