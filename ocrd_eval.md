# Quality Assurance in OCR-D

## Rationale

Estimating the quality of OCR requires workflows run on representative data,
evaluation metrics and evaluation tools that need to work together in a
well-defined manner to allow users to make informed decisions about which OCR
solution works best for their use case.

## Evaluation metrics

<!-- normative -->

## Evaluation JSON schema

<!-- normative -->

The results of an evaluation should be expressed in JSON according to
the [`ocrd-eval.json`](https://ocr-d.de/en/spec/ocrd-eval.schema.json).

## Tools

<!-- non-normative -->
